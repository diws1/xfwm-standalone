# xfwm-standalone

## Why xfwm ?
xfwm has the all window manager features i need. Like most window managers, I just had to add a few things to make it ready to use, and it was even easier in my opinion.

## How to install xfwm ? 
xfwm is generally provided by the package <b>xfwm4</b>. \

to get started, you can start xfwm with a display manager. in my case i use <b>lightdm</b>, so i need to create [<b>xfwm4.desktop</b>](https://github.com/diws1/xfwm-standalone/blob/main/usr/share/xsessions/xfwm4.desktop) file on my <b><i>/usr/share/xsessions/</i></b> directory.
